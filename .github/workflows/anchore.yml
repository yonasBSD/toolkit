# This workflow uses actions that are not certified by GitHub. They are
# provided by a third-party and are governed by separate terms of service,
# privacy policy, and support documentation.

# This workflow checks out code, builds an image, performs a container image
# vulnerability scan with Anchore's Grype tool, and integrates the results with
# GitHub Advanced Security code scanning feature.  For more information on the
# Anchore scan action usage and parameters, see
# https://github.com/anchore/scan-action. For more information on Anchore's
# container image scanning tool Grype, see https://github.com/anchore/grype
